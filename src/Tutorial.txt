------------RUNECRAFT GAMEPLAY------------
INSTRUCTIONS:

Similar to rock-paper-scissors, you will
randomly be given 20 runes. Each rune has
5 weaknesses and 5 attack methods. What
rune types and how many a player gets,
is randomly generated. There are a total of
11 different rune Types.

The rune in the middle, called Pure Essence,
is a wild-card and can attack any other rune,
without having any weaknesses. These runes
are rare and the player may obtain only one
Pure Essence per game.

ENVIRONMENT:

After every 5 turns, the environment of the
game will be randomly changed. Each environment
gives certain runes power-ups.

* Each power-up the environment gives will last
until the environment changes.

COSMIC- Runes Soul, Mind and Cosmic become immune.
WATER- Runes Water, Air and Body become immune.
FIRE- Runes Fire, Blood and Chaos can attack all.
EARTH- Runes Nature and Law can attack all and
become immune.

Due to the power-ups, if both runes:
* Have the ability to attack each other, then the battle will end in a tie.
* Are immune to each other, then the battle will end in a tie.
